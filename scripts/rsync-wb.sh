# I believe this cut line is simpler than using awk with print arguments. This series of commands looks for the "+" in the rsync log file and removes everything up to and including the last "+". Then grep filters out the first supposed file in the list which is just "./". After this, sed takes over and strips all the subdirectories from the first "/" encountered after the parent directory name(s). All that's then left to do is to wipe out all the duplicate lines so that all that remains is each parent directory without any duplication and unique files. It essentially creates the same list as what's in the /finished/ folder but at least it's from a confirmed rsync log file rather than working on assumptions, just to keep the script robust.
